# FIFO-Buffer-4-Entry-
This repository contains the design, implementation, and simulation of a 4-entry FIFO (First-In-First-Out) Buffer using Verilog HDL. The project demonstrates how to build a FIFO like a professional digital design engineerâ€”covering circuit thinking, RTL coding, and verification.
